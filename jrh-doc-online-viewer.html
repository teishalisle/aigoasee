                            <p> # Intro Hey there, fellow indie game dev. Let’s cut to the chase: you’ve got a game that you've either just started working on, or maybe it’s already late in production and you need to start building its home on Steam, or maybe your page already exists but it could use some improvement. Whatever the case, you want your Steam page to be as efficient as possible, bringing in good traffic and converting it into wishlists and ultimately sales. I’m going to try and use what experience I’ve gained. #Hearthstone Beginners Guide (Year of the Dragon) ####Note: Old Adventures (Kobolds and Catacombs and Knights of the Frozen Throne) can be purchased for free in the Blizzard store with the next patch in mid-May - - - If this is a bit overwhelming, or you just want a general direction, you want to beat all the AI on each difficulty, get all classes to Level 10, one class to Level 20, and complete your daily quests and weekly Tavern Brawls. --- 1.

gt No recipe game this week. While a few have been awesome and resulted in a lot of fun and good looking recipes, a couple have failed to spark the creativity of the masses. /u/ID10-T, on the other hand, has no shortage of ideas which is clear from his participation and, ya know, the fact that he has 1300+ recipes on ATF. (https://alltheflavors.com/users/ID10-T) gtThis week I’m just going to announce a giveaway happening over on the DIY_eJuice Discord (https://discord.gg/B5uyPVt). #The Pre Rambling gt Honestly this mod job has me a little jaded by the end of the week. After removing too many posts in an attempt to keep this place clean, it gets hard to see the forest for the trees… but then I start putting together this post and every week I’m reminded of why I do it. There was actually so much good content this week, it was hard to fit it all in. And the other thing that keeps my enthusiasm alive is the DIY Discord (https://discord.gg/ufVTyAQ) which People who only saw the Netflix version would come out thinking it's balanced and unbiased, at one point myself included. It initially left me with three things: The abduction is possible because it established Portugal as unsafe and has pedophile rings The Portugal police is incompetent and the investigation is botched The parents were victims of online hate and scams However after reading more about the case, listening and watching other documentaries it paints a different story. She was using Windows 7. amp#x200B; She called me to come to help because she couldn't play the movie that was on a USB stick I gave her on her computer. amp#x200B; It was in h265 and she used media player, didn't know about VLC. I could have just installed VLC, it would have got the job done, but I felt like converting her, she was on a system that won't be supported anymore in not that long, and too worried about security issues to use her credit card online. amp#x200B; If you were to go to a master woodworker's shop, you'd invariably find a plethora of tools that he or she uses to accomplish various tasks. In software it is the same. You can measure a software developer by how they use their tools. Experienced software developers master their tools. It is important to learn your current tools deeply, and be aware of alternatives to fill in gaps where your current ones fall short. With that in mind, I present to you a gigantic list of tools. Hey everyone! I've been having this problem and it's been stumping me. A few weeks ago these BSODs started happening for no reason. amp#x200B; I wish I had any kind of dump file on hand, but everytime a BSOD happens it just crashes in the middle of the BSOD. My laptop either shuts down during the BSOD or it just gets stuck at 0% Complete. amp#x200B; I've done everything I could think of to try and fix this issue and nothing seems to be pointing me in the right direction. I've tried:. 
Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com (https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview. Today's interview is with Barron Cuadro of Effortless Gent (https://www.effortlessgent.com), a men's style publication.

I’m Barron and I run Effortless Gent (https://effortlessge. Hey there. We’re one day away from the Major. It’s tomorrow! Everyone on board this boat is excited to deliver the best possible show for the fans on site and the viewers at home. I’m writing this letter to you to outline what to expect until March 3rd and how much it means to us to have a Major again. CSGO Majors are meant to be a service to the community, to unite the world around an amazing show featuring their favorite game. They’re also supposed to be landmark events that raise Hey all, I am pretty new to the competitive scene and have been looking around for various resources about how to get better. I came across a video series on Youtube called " The Dojo: Road to Evo " where the hosts took a relatively new Street Fighter 5 player and coached him for \~26 weeks in preparation for Evo 2016.While the series focuses on SF5, I think a lot of the concepts carry over to other fighting games. At the end of most episodes, they give "homework" for the viewer to follow Hey everyone, I have put together a reading list of Austrian books below (with some important compilations, essays, and articles) for the sub’s sidebar, organized into categories. Most of the books listed here have free online PDFs, making it more accessible (for the few that don't, my apologies). I know there’s a ton more material that could be included, but it would get too jumbled. Also, there is temptation to include good quality work like Thomas Sowell’s Basic Economics, for example This is a pretty long fucked up, odd, sad, lonely and desperate as shit story. I need to tell it to get it off my chest because untill now, due to the unusual and embarrassing circumstances, I've told no one the full story and it's literally fucking me up pretty badly inside. I'll try to keep it brief but then I need to tell it all so I can really voice the frustration and sorrow this has all caused me, and hopefully get some relief in doing so and maybe some advice. I've struggled Hi! It's me, the one who decided to monitor YouTube view count ratings for all of the performers throughout the run time! Now that we're nearing a week after the show has officially aired, I think it's officially time for me to publish these results and solidify them in paper.

Seven months ago, there was this survey (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GfDkmMKZfoO4eGKBFhrkqopnQPxef8Tega0CzTx-F_Y/edit) done by /u/PumpyChowdown on r/StarWars. In this post, I wanted to go through the survey, and identify what frequenters of that sub posted; correlations; and what I personally think of it, and how it will affect the Star Wars franchise presently, and in the future. I've done several large surveys on r/HarryPotter before myself, including a survey of similar So you'd like to develop for the Nintendo 64, but don't really know where to start? I'll give you a run-down of things you'll need to either hack/translate your favourite games, along with a list of resources where you can code and develop N64 Games. Some things you'll need (or should have) are either a 64Drive HW2 or an Everdrive V3 (this version has the usb port), MIPS/ASM experience, a Hex Editor (or Calculator) and experience with C programming , along with a Cycle-. #Reddit "Starters Guide" To Hearthsone - - - If this is a bit overwhelming, or you just want a general direction, you want to beat all the AI on each difficulty, get all classes to Level 10, one class to Level 20, and complete your daily quests and weekly Tavern Brawls. --- 1.

Formats. Hey everyone. This is a lot less about Minecraft than it is about the Pi itself. There is a lot of explaining to do, and this might be a little dumb as I've been working on this for only a day now. I might not even be working on the right problem. Also, I'm sorry if this is in the wrong location, I wasn't sure if it would fit in the help thread. For starters - I'm doing all of this on a MacBook and I am connecting to my Pi through VNC Viewer. I don't believe the networking is the issue. Yester. </p>
