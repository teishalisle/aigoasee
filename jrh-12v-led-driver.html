I am planning on installing under cabinet LEDs (SMD2835 diodes, 60/m, ~10m total length, ~48w total) using the existing switch and wiring previously used for a garbage disposal. Getting an appropriate constant 12v LED driver and hooking it up to an on/off switch is no problem, but I am stuck figuring out my options for dimming them. The usual way is with a 0-10v LED driver and switch, right? That would require some rewiring, since the line currently goes to the switch first but in a 0-10v.

Hey /r/AskElectronics, my Google-Fu was weak and could not find an answer. When you have a 3.3v logic signal like a GPIO pin from a Raspberry Pi and need to boost it to 5v or 5v+ for applications like PWM of LED drivers, what kind of circuitry or boards can you cobble together to make that voltage shift happen? My application is taking a 3.3v GPIO pin from a Raspberry Pi and connecting it to a PWM pin on a 12v LED driver to handle dimming of a 10w LED emitter. My understanding Can we simplify growing lights starting with buying this driver gt it says with 180w driver you can power 16.5 meter 5050 led strip light per 60led/m which is this one i assume gt http://www.ebay.com/itm/5M-300LED-SMD-3528-5050-5630-RGB-White-Flexible-Strip-Light-Remote-Power-Supply-/181929534674?var=amphash=item2a5. I recently set up an LED strip circuit (2ft long) inside a Faraday cage -like box in order to do electrophys (EEG) experiments. We have the circuit connected to a rotary dimmer that is connected to a 12V LED driver. What we've noticed is that our EEG electrodes have a lot of background noise when the LEDs are connected to the dimmer; a bit of noise when the dimmer is fully on or turned fully off; and no background noise when the LEDs are connected straight to the LED driver. How do you connect 3v LEDs to a 35W 12v LED driver. Hi Guys, as stated above, I need some advice on that matter. I'm currently thinking of upgrading a display lamp that uses a GU4-MR11 12v halogen lamp to a LED lamp ( of the same specs. In the lamp, there is a 12Vac synchronous motor that looks some thing like this. ( I would like to know if the motor is able to run on a 12V LED driver. 
I want to use IKEA Tradfri to power my LED downlights. The driver supplies 24v while my downlights use 12v. The downlights are not from IKEA. Does anyone know if it will be sufficient to connect two downlights in series to reduce the voltage? amp#x200B; Thanks. I did a search for other posts about LED strips, which helped a lot, but I really really don't want to die in a fire, so I'd be grateful for any feedback on my plans. Please let me know if I should be posting this elsewhere. I'm planning to put led strips along the perimeter of my living room ceiling. After some research I realized one strip of leds in series would be way too long. and I was also hoping they would be dimmable. So now, here's my new plan. An electrician has already install. I've installed a heated bed on a Simple Metal. Installation went smoothly following the printrbot instructions- Installing Simple Metal Heat Bed Upgrade. Since I've installed the heated bed, I set the temperature for the hot end- the hot end will reach temperature and affect the bed temperature slightly. When I set a temperature for the bed (say 60C) and the hot end(say 190C), the bed will heat up to temp as expected, but the hot end will raise temperature, sometimes in the neighborhood Hello, amp#x200B; First time poster! I've gotten into hobby electronics recently, and have been trying to improve my PCB design skills by learning some best practices for design. Towards that effort, I've designed this programmable motor driver in Eagle, based around the DRV8800 full bridge driver ( The board is capable of running four brushed DC motors or two bipolar stepper motors with up to 2A continuously. The board has an integrated Atmega6. Specifically talking about smaller 1" lights, and the rise of triple 3V LEDs. I think the XHP35 and 35 Hi are far better options. Here's why: Less heat More stable output More balanced beam instead of being all flood No need for a wider, flared head Forces manufacturers to use better boost drivers instead of lazy FETs Tends not to burn out LEDs or otherwise expect unsustainable performance I will concede that even the high CRI XHP35 Hi won't be as pretty as a 219b triple Gallery is here: https://imgur.com/a/daRTcjU (https://imgur.com/a/daRTcjU) Hi folks! A buddy of mine recently bought a new set of Milwaukee tools, and it included this work light (https://www.homedepot.ca/product/milwaukee-tool-m18-led-work-light/1000730431). I was having some beverages with him this afternoon, and ended up playing with the light. I was sorely disappointed. (A Nichia 219C Emisar D4 lives on my hip). The literature claims it puts out 140 lumens. I was expecting 
I've been thinking about installing LED strips throughout the house so I have good lighting when there's a power outage(a common enough problem in my area) and to lower the electric bill , and those would be powered by a flooded lead acid battery which will be charged by a solar panel. The one problem I haven't figured out yet is how I will protect the led strips, as the voltage supplied would be anywhere between 13.7 and 10.5(or whatever cutoff rates I set at the charge controller).
